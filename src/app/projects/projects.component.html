<h1>Personal Projects</h1>

<h2>Previous Project: Autumn Fall</h2>

<p>
Autumn Fall was the final project from my website development and 
maintanence course at ECU.  This project features strictly HTML 
and CSS with minimal Javascript for toggling content as needed.  
Due to experience level and time restraints when I worked on this 
project, it does not demonstrate responsive web design principles.  
I enjoyed this project as my first foray into web development.

<h2>Previous Project:  Quiz Maker</h2>

<p>
My most recent project was my Quiz Maker application.  This app 
allows anyone to make a simple html quiz regardless of their 
prior programming knowledge.  Quiz Maker allows the user to style 
the background and text colors of both the question and answer area, 
fill out the questions they wish to submit, and offers a template that 
the user can simply copy and paste straight into a document with a 
html extension.  The quiz scores itself and provides the correct 
answer to any questions the quiz-taker answered incorrectly.  This app 
was written in both Angular and AngularJs with the source code containing 
some differences between the two versions.

<h2>Most Recent Project:  Resume</h2>

<p>
This small application is my latest project that I have completed.  I 
felt that this app could be a good way for potential employers or fellow 
developers to understand my personal values and vision for myself while 
providing an example of my work.  If you wish to view my other projects, 
links to them are provided in their respective repositories on my Github.  
If I can be of assistance, feel free to 
contact me using the contact information provided underneath my portrait.  
Thank you for viewing my work and have a great day.
